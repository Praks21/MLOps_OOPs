1. class and object
2. class has data/attribute and function/methods
    > Code walkthrough
    > attribute get called itself, methods are called manually
3. Why python is called OOP? everything in python is an object(data structure,data types etc)
4. Adv of oops:
    > you can create your own datatypes
    > code reusability
    > debugging
    > easy to collab

5. end to end project(chitchat class)
    > function vs method
    > magic methods or dunder methods
    > self
    > you can creta attribute outside class 
    > encapsulation
    > getter and setter
    > static method
    > decorator

6. Inheritance
    >Inheritance code example
    > why inheritance is neede? ( code reusability, parent has no access to chuild class)
    > what gets inherited? - constructor, Non private attributes, Non Private methods
    > constructor overloading & method overloading
    > super keyword ( can be used onlu inside, cannot access variable/attributes, used only inside child class)
    > type of inheritance - 1. single | 2. Multilevel | 3. Hierarchical | 4. Multiple <Diamond Problem> | 5. Hybrid
